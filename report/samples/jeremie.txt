To make this IA, I decided to create a Min Max algorithm which takes the best position option for the given piece, and gives the enemy a piece that will make him less likely to win. In order to do that I had to calculate the weight of every playable board to know which one I had to choose. To calculate the weight I simply took the board of which I wanted to know the weight, and added up all the characteristics of all the pieces on the board one by one. Then I had to compare them with each other to take the minimal one. Once I had done that for one board, I had to do it for all the other boards that are linked to the original board, and put the minimal value of each one into a list, and finally I took the minimal value of this list. Then I picked the board that had this minimal value.
To know which piece I have to give my opponent, I used the same system as before, but this time I took the board with the highest weight.
