The AI prepare the Board for the first 5 turn, minimizing the number of alignment between each pieces in the board, and by giving pieces sharing the fewer attributes with the piece the AI receive.
Why the five first turn are preparing the board? Because when you mimizing the number of alignement the fifth turn can share attributes between 2 and more lines. Thanks to all pieces giving because you giving all pieces that sharing fewer attributes as possible and the opponement have to pose them choosing by align with other pieces and not. In wich case it can helps us to do more alignement.

For next turns, the AI became more agressive by giving non loosing pieces and maximizing the number of attributes share with the last piece receive by the AI. And choosing position where we can maximizing the number of share aligments with the maximum of share. If the Board is too bad the AI (loosing next turn), then the AI play in a position that can free some pieces to give and possibly can switch the Board into good board (winning next turn).
